# Modified version of Vienna theme

Original at: https://github.com/keichi/vienna

* A bunch of changes so in the end it kinda looks like Octopress-like theme
* When it comes to HTML/CSS/js, I have _no idea_ what I'm doing, so don't look at any of that as "something proper"
* See in action at https://aras-p.info/
