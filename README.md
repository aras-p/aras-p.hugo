# aras-p.hugo

This is just [my website](http://aras-p.info/), content &amp; [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) bits.

Perhaps the only thing of possible interest is the theme at `themes/aras` folder. I took [Vienna](https://github.com/keichi/vienna)
theme as a starting point, and kept on modifying it until it kinda looked similar to my previous [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
based website look.
