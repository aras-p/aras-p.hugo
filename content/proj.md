Some free-time and open source programming projects i've got my hands on. 
There were some old things from MS-DOS/ZX Spectrum/Atari times, but I lost them. Some
of the projects are done with other members of [nesnausk!](https://nesnausk.org) group.
I keep a bunch of smaller recent projects on [**github**](https://github.com/aras-p).


### Tools and libraries

[**Clang Build Analyzer**](https://github.com/aras-p/ClangBuildAnalyzer) (2019)<br />

[**GLSL optimizer**](https://github.com/aras-p/glsl-optimizer) (2010)<br />
Some platforms (especially mobile) are weak at optimizing GLSL shaders, so this
library can be used offline to do inlining, dead code removal, copy propagation
and other fancy stuff.
