Some free-time and open source programming projects i've got my hands on. My _real actual work_
happens on [**Unity**](http://unity3d.com) nowadays &ndash; check it out.
There were some old things from DOS/ZXSpectrum/Atari times, but I lost them. Some
of the projects are done with other members of [nesnausk!](http://www.nesnausk.org) group.
I keep a bunch of smaller recent projects on [**github**](https://github.com/aras-p).
