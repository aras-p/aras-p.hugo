[Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games) had a theme "What Home Means to You".
We thought, *"what if you are a floor-cleaning robot?"* Home means
picking up dirt and stuff from the floor.

My 9yo daughter did all the graphics and some sounds. I assembled the stuff in Unity,
recorded some sounds and made the "music" with help of guitar and GarageBand. It's nothing fancy, but
was quite fun to make!
