Sometimes I work for 8 hours with almost no results. Sometimes, I can do much more in 3 hours.

Things that help me (examples from IC05 demo): write down a detailed, roughly prioretized [task list](http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/dingus/trunk/ic2005/todo.txt?view=markup). If I don't write it down and keep tasks in my head, I often spend too much time polishing not-so-important features. With task list, I [update it](http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/dingus/trunk/ic2005/todo.txt?view=log) constantly; at the same time I get sort of 'summary' of remaining work.

Another one: really concentrate. Turn off music (for some reason I can't work while music is playing... especially if the music is good, I start listening to it), close the doors, tell the child 'go play with mom instead' :), etc.

More: disconnect from the net while working :)
