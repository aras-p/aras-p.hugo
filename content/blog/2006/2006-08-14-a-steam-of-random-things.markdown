Awards: Hey, [we](http://unity3d.com)'ve got a "runner up" award in [Apple Design Awards 2006](http://developer.apple.com/ada/), Best Use of Graphics category! Yeah, a runner up is more like "the first of the losers", but oh well. Got beaten by modo 201, which probably is a fair trade. It's just that we thought we'd be in Best Developer Tool category, but that is apparently for text editors and scripting languages :)

Demos: In the other news, fellow [ReJ](http://nesnausk.org/members.php) with TBL just won Assembly 2006 demo competition with an [Amiga demo](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=25778), putting all PC demos faces' to dust. Check it out. Art direction over hardware capabilities, one more time.

Drivers: why oh why the graphics drivers must be so bad? The other day I was thinking why can't they auto-update themselves (with an option to turn it off for corporate users etc.). Now you've got a (not so recent!) driver that is able to parse vertex programs wrong, and a user who does not have a clue that he should update it. It's bad enough to have a bug in the first place, but auto-update at least would fix...

Or you have a driver that says "I'm OpenGL 1.2!" but the 3D texture functions are null. And it's the most recent driver for a particular graphics card that you can buy today! And it's not even a hard problem! What the developers are thinking - they go over the required GL 1.2 functionality, see that some is actually missing and decide "ah, screw it, we'll say it's 1.2 anyways"?!

I just don't get it. I could use some enlightenment on this.
