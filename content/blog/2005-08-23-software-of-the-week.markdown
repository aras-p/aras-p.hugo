It's never too early for Software Of The Week awards, even if it's only Tuesday. Ladies and gentlement, Aras' picks are:

  
* **Software That Rocks** award goes to [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) and [PmWiki](http://www.pmwiki.org/). Both are slick, sexy and do not try to annoy you. They actually work (that's already something!), they do not crash whenever I do just-a-bit-non-usual action, they do not corrupt my files behind my back.

* **Software That Sucks** award this week goes to Oracle [Reports](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/reports/index.html) and [Designer](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/designer/index.html) 10g. Sorry dear Oracle, but the best description I have for those is "Ugh". For a longer description, just invert everything that's written in the first point.

See you later!
