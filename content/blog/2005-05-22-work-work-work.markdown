Demo demo demo! Beware!

We still have a chance to finish it on time. I've taked a day off the work tomorrow and want it to be really finished by tomorrow evening _(or night)_. The real deadline is after 4 days, but I've got to test it on various hardware...

It's going pretty well, I think. It works, other team members say it looks pretty good (myself - I'm not sure, I think I've been watching it for too long). Does 100-150FPS on my GeForce 6800GT at 1024x768 with some FSAA. Again, we're under-utilizing the available hardware :)

Back to work.
