After a long period of silence _nesnausk!_ releases another demo - [Zenit](http://nesnausk.org/project.php?project=16). Check it out. This is actually almost a one-man show: the concept, modeling, animations and code was done by [Paulius](http://nesnausk.org/members.php#2). I did see how the real camera looks like when fully disassembled into almost 500 parts - it's scary!

Ah... makes me want to do some demo again. Maybe someday!
