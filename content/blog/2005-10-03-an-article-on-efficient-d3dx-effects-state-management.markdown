I wrote an article on the subject I was [talking](/blog/2005/09/24/state-management-in-d3dx-effects) [about](/blog/2005/09/27/state-management-in-d3dx-effects-2) recently - an auto-magical system that manages device states in the effects. The article and links to implementation are on my homepage here: [aras-p.info/texts/d3dx_fx_states.html](http://aras-p.info/texts/d3dx_fx_states.html)
