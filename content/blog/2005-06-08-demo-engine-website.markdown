Ok, I've released sourcecode for our demo engine/tools and the demo itself [a while ago](/blog/2005/04/22/enginedemo-sourcecode-released), now time to actually put up at least a minimal website, with some articles, download/build instructions and whatnot.

So, here it is: [http://dingus.berlios.de](http://dingus.berlios.de) (oh, and it has an [rss feed](http://dingus.berlios.de/index.php?n=Main.RecentChanges?action=rss) of the recent changes, yay!).

Currently it's half empty; I expect to write some more short articles soon. Maybe even put up some standalone tools... I know that the sourcecode is useless, but I thought "maybe the articles would be good". Or maybe not, who knows.
