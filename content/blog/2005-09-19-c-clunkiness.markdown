Here I am coding [various things](/blog/2005/09/01/project-hoshimi-2006) and it suddenly struck me: C++ is pretty clunky. Now, I knew this to some extent for quite a time already, but the more I code C++ the more clunky it feels.

I admire it as a low-level language; it's very powerful and there's lots of unbelievable things you can do with it (think templates).

But still, it feels like a low-level one. I really want to code by "next project" (whatever that might be) in Lua, for example (especially now that [LuaJIT](http://luajit.luaforge.net) is out).
