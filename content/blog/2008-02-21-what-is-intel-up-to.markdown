Seriously, what are they up to? Intel [acquires Offset Software](http://www.projectoffset.com/news.php), a game development studio that is doing a game and an engine. Wait, I was thinking the game and tech are for PC and Xbox360? What would Intel do with that?

Not so long ago, some well known graphics guys [went to work for Intel](http://www.beyond3d.com/content/news/557). A while ago Intel [acquired Neoptica](http://www.beyond3d.com/content/news/534)...

Signs of [Larrabee][1] coming? Intel starting to take GPUs seriously? Something else?
