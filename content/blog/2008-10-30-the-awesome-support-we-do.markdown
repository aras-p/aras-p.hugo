Yesterday's experience catching up with Unity forums, as I remember it:

Take a quick look at zillions of new posts.

Answer about five questions with "what's the value of your camera's near plane?".

There should be some way to automate all of this. For every 20th question, reply with "increase your near plane!", or something.
