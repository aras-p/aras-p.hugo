Mixing a sprint of bug fixing before the release and Tom Waits' music results in interesting combination. For example, [Crossroads][1] describes bug fixing process perfectly:


> And that's where ol' George found himself out there at the FogBugz  
Fixin' the devil's bugs  
Now, a man figures it's his bugs and he'll assign whom he wants  
But it don't always work out that way  
You see, some bugs are special for a certain target  
A certain platform, or a certain person  
And no matter whom you're assignin', that's where the bug 'll end up  
And in the moment of assigning your mouse turns into a dowser's wand  
And clicks where the bug wants to go.


Uhm. Yeah.
