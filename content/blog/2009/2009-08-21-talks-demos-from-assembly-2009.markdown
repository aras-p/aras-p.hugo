I went to [Assembly 2009](http://www.assembly.org/summer09/?set_language=en) demoparty this year.

No demo submissions, but I did a seminar presentation about developing graphics technology for small games ([PDF slides](/texts/files/Assembly09-Aras-GfxTech.pdf)). Mostly on hardware statistics, GPU features, testing and stability:

However, the **awesome talk was given by ReJ**: low level iPhone (pre-3GS) rendering details ([PDF slides](http://blogs.unity3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Assembly09-iPhone-Learning-GPU-from-Driver-Code.pdf)). Inner workings of iPhone's GPU, OpenGL ES drivers, command buffers, VFP assembly and so on. Bringing assembly back to the Assembly, yeah!

If you're going to watch some demos from Assembly 2009, make sure to see:



  * [Frameranger](http://capped.tv/cncd_orange_fairlight-frameranger) (1st place demo). Rocked the big screen! Seems somewhat unfinished though.


  * [The Golden Path](http://capped.tv/united_force_digital_dynamite-the_golden_path) (3rd place demo) - for something fresh. Also, a good way to disprove the saying that "the winners don't take drugs" :)


  * [Muon Baryon](http://capped.tv/youth_uprising_mlat_design_out-muon_baryon) (1st place 4 kilobyte intro) - that's what kids do with sphere marching on the GPU these days.
