Finally, [Unity 2.0](http://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-2.0) is out. Took a bit longer than we expected (but not 3.1415926 times longer, so we're all good), but now, after half a year in beta testing, over a dozen alpha/beta releases, it is finally shipped. Feels good!

We pretty much spent the summer doing 800 svn commits/month with about four major code monkeys :) Now that the release is done I fully expect the graph to drop off to low values again (is it called "burnout"?).

It was like, _oh my, it's full of people and all about unity!_ In other words, really really cool.

It has to!">}}](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/willitlaunch.jpg)The night before the conference was spent in the hotel, doing last tweaks to the website and launch demos. If the presenters during keynote talk looked confused or exhausted, that's a combination of trans-Atlantic flight _and_ this last night of work. In fact, the very last fixes to the website were done during the keynote... oh well, Murphy's law for the win.

Now what? Time to start working on Unity 2.x release :)
