The company I was [working at](http://aras-p.info/cv.html) for some three years, closed it's offices in Kaunas recently. Well, it was almost a year when both intera and motion parts of the name didn't already make any sense... At start we were doing computer vision, various game/graphics/entertainment stuff, but in the last year all development was about some computer networks management system. A couple of programmers will stay for some time to support existing systems, but afaik any new development is suspended.

I feel kinda sad, even if I blame the management for the failures mostly _(we programmers never blame ourselves, you know :))_. Yes, I/we could have worked harder, done better etc., but all the way I (and probably 'we') felt that the ambitions were too unrealistic (*), the business plans were too non-existant, the management was just a bit too poor, and some forward-thinking was 'just a bit missing'.

I guess that's just my attempt to transfer blame to someone else :)

That said, it's still sad. Oh well, just keep going on.

_(*) Ambitions: "by that time Sony, Nintendo and Konami will be years behind us" doesn't sound very realistic, does it? :)_
