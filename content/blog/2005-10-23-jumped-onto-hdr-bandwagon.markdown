I'm doing a small HDR demo for fun. Nothing fancy - linear gamma, Reinhard's tone mapping and whatnot - everyone does that. But the thing I made so far does not even look good! :)

I'm trying to support both HDR and FSAA at the same time on ordinary DX9 hardware (no Radeons 1k) by using RGBE8 rendertarget for the main scene. It's all okay so far.

The most difficult task right now is making it look good. Once I have that I'll post the results.
