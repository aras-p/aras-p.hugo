Richard "legalize" Thomson (the organizer of [Pilgrimage](http://pilgrimage.scene.org/) demoparty and DirectX MVP) just told me: he has done a [2-minute analysis](http://www.scene.org/file.php?file=%2Fparties%2F2005%2Fpilgrimage05%2Fwild%2Flegalize_wild.wmv&fileinfo) of our demo engine [dingus](http://dingus.berlios.de/) as a "wild demo". It took 3rd place in wild demo competition at Pilgrimage'05!

That is pretty funny. I never knew it has so much sourcecode inside! :)
