This is just too cool: _Off-Road Velociraptor Safari_ game. Read that again. Who says game industry is all about sequels and safe licenses?

You drive a jeep with a spiky ball, and your goal is to chase down raptors and send them to the future, presumably to end world hunger. Or you can do stunts. And _you the driver_ are a raptor, only you wear a hat and a monocle.

Just go and play it already: [**raptorsafari.com**](http://raptorsafari.com/). It's free.

Or watch a [trailer](http://www.vimeo.com/618534) if you want to miss all the _real_ fun, or read a [press release](http://raptorsafari.com/press-raptor-feathers.php). _Of course_ it's made in Unity, in two months from start to finish.

To me, this is a perfect example of focus. Basically there are three things - 1) vehicle, 2) raptors, 3) physics mayhem - and that almost describes a game. Yes, there are crates and stunts and achievements and online leaderboards, but that's just additional stuff on top of the core game.

Sounds like a good plan for making game prototypes:




  1. Think up a game idea and describe it in one concise sentence. The idea may be totally crazy, like in this case. I guess an idea like Velociraptor Safari would not fly in a pitch at any publisher, but that does not matter at this point.


  2. Get a small team of smart people. In Flashbang's case, it seems they were 4 to 7 person team.


  3. Choose a game engine/toolset that will allow you to make your game fast. *cough cough*


  4. _Do it!_



All the above requires is a small smart team and groceries/rent for a couple of months.

Your original idea may be totally crazy, but with the actual working prototype at hand it might _just work_. Looks like Velociraptor Safari really clicked something on the internets (see [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/350934/please-go-play-velociraptor-safari), [JayIsGames](http://jayisgames.com/archives/2008/01/offroad_velociraptor_safari.php), [Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/off-road-velociraptor-safari-is-out-go-murder-raptors-with-a-jeep-67798.phtml), [TIGSource](http://tigsource.com/articles/2008/01/29/off-road-velociraptor-safari), [AtomicGamer](http://www.atomicgamer.com/article.php?id=525), ...).
