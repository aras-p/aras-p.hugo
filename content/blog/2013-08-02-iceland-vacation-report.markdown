title: Iceland Vacation Report

*tl;dr: Just spent a week in Iceland and it was awesome!*

Some folks have asked for impressions of my Iceland vacation or some advice, so here it goes. Caveats: my first (and only so far) trip there, we went with kids, came up with the itinerary ourselves (with some advice from friends), etc.

Our trip was one week; myself, my wife and two kids (10 and 4yo). If you're going alone, or for a honeymoon, or with a group of friends, the experience might be *very* different. Without small kids, I'd go for longer than a week, and try to wander further away from main roads.


** Planning **

Summary of what we wanted:

* Go in summer so it's fairly warm.
* Stay away from people ;) Well, at least a bit.
* No serious hiking climbing; just rent a car and go places.

Asking friends, reading the internets (wikitravel, wikipedia, lonely planet, random blogs), came up with a list of "places I'd like to go". Used [Google Maps Engine Lite](https://mapsengine.google.com) to layout the plan, and google maps to estimate driving times.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-planning.png">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-planning.png)

The plan was mostly to explore the nothern part of Iceland, staying in Akureyri for 3 nights; and last two nights in Reykjavik.

We booked *everything* in advance. Larger places (Akureyri and Reykjavik) through [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) -- so far all my experiences with airbnb have been very positive, and it's much nicer to stay in an actual apartment instead of some generic hotel/guesthouse. Towns in Iceland are extremely small though - Akureyri, being the 2nd largest city outside of Reykjavik area, is only 18000. Which means airbnb is only really practical in Reykjavik & Akureyri. We booked some small cottages & guesthouses for several nights elsewhere (through tripadvisor, booking.com etc.).


** Driving **

Rented a car in advance as well. For the first Iceland trip decided to go "casual driving". Car rental is *expensive*. In our case, we paid as much for a simple Renault Megane as we paid for all the housing. Rent a local GPS; neither Apple nor Google maps have very good road coverage, and cell connectivity might be shaky in more remote places. 

Paved roads (the 1 "ring road" and most of two-digit roads) are good quality but not wide. Larger gravel roads are okay. Smaller gravel roads are small and rocky -- and we didn't even go to more mountain places. Big chunk of area inside the land is only accessible by 4x4 vehicles; which we decided not to do this time.

Notes! When a sign says "blindhæd", it means exactly that - a road goes through a top of some hill and you wouldn't see a car approaching in front. Gas stations are around towns, but you can easily have 100km without a single station in between. Some clouds literally sit on the ground; and visibility while driving through that is really, *really* bad - couple dozen meters. Sheep often found on the gravel roads. A lot of bridges that are only wide enough for one car. Driving off-road is illegal to preserve vegetation (hey it takes several thousand years for even moss to start growing on lava fields).

Generaly driving conditions are okay *(in summer and good weather at least ;))*, there's little traffic going on, and other drivers are very considerate. When two cars have to pass by on a narrow road, one of them often carefully stops several hundred meters away to let the other through. For me, the hardest thing was just that driving 4-5 hours each day is tiring (hey my usual daily dose is 30 minutes! and I don't like driving to begin with). That, and driving through the clouds - your eyes are used to scanning the road at least several hundred meters ahead, but you can't quite do that in the cloud.

Next time I'm going there, I want to get a 4x4 and go more remote places. The beauty and non-Earthiness of the landscapes is too stunning.


*Next up: travel log with pictures. SPOILER ALERT!*


** Day 1: Þingvellir and Deildartunguhver **

Landed in Keflavik airport past midnight, got our car and slept over in some guesthouse in Keflavik itself.

[Þingvellir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir) park with rift valley - somewhat too many people for my taste ;). Took smaler gravel roads up north. Surprise find - a lake with flat as a mirror surface; I didn't even notice the lake at first. Sandkluftavatn is the name.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-sandkluftavatn.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-sandkluftavatn.jpg)

[Deildartunguhver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deildartunguhver) hot springs. Fairly impressive to see boiling water coming out of the earth, just like that.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-deildartunguhver.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-deildartunguhver.jpg)

Also, the smell! This is a common theme - Iceland has abundant hot water that's used for heating & stuff, but most of it has that hard boiled eggs sulfur smell. They somehow do not mention the smell in, for example, [Blue Lagoon](http://www.bluelagoon.is/) advertising material ;)

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-smell.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-smell.jpg)

Pathfinding in the GPS led us through some scary road where 7km lasted forever, mostly in 1st gear and trying to avoid damaging the car's underside or rolling off a hill. A jeep would have been useful. A fence sign that could either be interpreted as "you'll be shot for going there" or "no shooting here" provided some nice ambiguity! That was the only scary driving experience I had. Moral here: if you're entering a road and wondering "I wonder if my car is really good for this", turn around *now*. The road will *not* get better!

Rest of the day, highway up to Hvammstangi, slept over in small, simple & nice cottages. *"Double story bed, yay!!!" -- kids*.


** Day 2: to Akureyri **

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-day2.png">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-day2.png)

The plan was "just get from Hvammstangi to Akureyri". Took a little detour to Skagafjördur.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-day2b.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-day2b.jpg)

Settled down in Akureyri, which we used as our "home base" for 3 nights. Really lovely town! Just small enough to be, well, small; and just large enough to have decent places to eat ;) Kids loved the swimming pool. Due to lots of natural hot water, swimming pools are *everywhere* in Iceland, and they are extremely cheap.

** Day 3: Ásbyrgi, Dettifoss, Mývatn **

Just found out now that our trip almost went along the "[Diamond Circle](http://www.diamondcircle.is/)" route. Akureyri -> Husavik -> Ásbyrgi -> Dettifoss -> Mývatn.

From Husavik people usually go on whale watching tours, but we only stopped for cupcakes.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-after-husavik.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-after-husavik.jpg)

[Ásbyrgi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81sbyrgi) canyon is impressive; hard to imagine all that being caused by water.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-asbyrgi.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-asbyrgi.jpg)

From the internets I imagined Ásbyrgi to be a cube of rock in the middle of nowhere; most of the photos show it like this. It's not a cube; that's just one end of a long wall.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-asbyrgi2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-asbyrgi2.jpg)

[Dettifoss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dettifoss) is *big*, but I don't have photos to do it justice. We went on the east side which is more gravel driving, but supposedly better view.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-dettifoss.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-dettifoss.jpg)

On our way back, accidental find - Hverarönd which gets you wondering "are we still on Earth?" - a bunch of fumaroles and mudpots.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-hverarond1.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-hverarond1.jpg)

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-hverarond3.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-hverarond3.jpg)

Next up, [Mývatn nature baths](http://www.jardbodin.is/index.php/en/) which folks say is a less touristy version of Blue Lagoon (we haven't been to that one). Less crowded = good in my book; even if Mývatn ones are still quite crowded. Water from 36 to 45˚C (97 to 113 F), sulfur smell, oh my!

Drive back to Akureyri and observe sunlight scattering in distant cloud of rain.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-scatter.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-scatter.jpg)


** Day 4: Godafoss, Dimmuborgir, Viti **

Same area around Mývatn. [Godafoss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godafoss) waterfall:

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-godafoss.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-godafoss.jpg)
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-godafoss2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-godafoss2.jpg)

[Dimmuborgir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmuborgir), which I wanted to check out if only because of
[Dimmu Borgir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmu_Borgir). It's okay. Not metal though ;)

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-dimmu1.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-dimmu1.jpg)
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-dimmu2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-dimmu2.jpg)

Cloud rolling over a mountain:

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-cloud.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-cloud.jpg)

There's also a [Hverfjall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hverfjall) crater right next to Dimmuborgir, but we decided not to climb it with kids. Next time?

Víti crater near [Krafla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krafla), and some fumaroles right next to it.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-viti.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-viti.jpg)
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-viti2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-viti2.jpg)

Thermal power plants there look like some alien constructions, with pipes spanning vast distances. Here, [Krafla power station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krafla_Power_Station):

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-plant.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-plant.jpg)


** Day 5: to Reykjavik **

Long drive from Akureyri to Reykjavik. Unplanned find, Grábrók crater right next to the highway; in a group of 3 craters.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-grabrok.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-grabrok.jpg)
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-grabrok2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-grabrok2.jpg)

Nice fBm noise generator for the terrain you've got there, Iceland:

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-terrain.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-terrain.jpg)

Arrive in Reykjavik, check out downtown. It's full of colors!

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-reyk2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-reyk2.jpg)


** Day 6: Geysir, Gullfoss **

[Geysir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geysir), the geyser that named them all, is mostly dormant now. However,
[Strokkur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strokkur) right next to it goes off each 3-5 minutes. There's *a lot* of people there and I initially was wary of that (*"them tourists ruin everything!"*) but geysers are indeed impressive.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-strokkur1.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-strokkur1.jpg)
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-strokkur2.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-strokkur2.jpg)

One of the eruptions, we were standing a bit further away to get a better view. Either the wind blew stronger, or the eruption was higher, or both -- but the water just landed onto all of us. Good thing it was not hot. Achievement unlocked: got soaked by the geyser!

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-strokkur3.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-strokkur3.jpg)

[Gullfoss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullfoss):

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-gullfoss.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-gullfoss.jpg)

And finally, friendly sheep joining us for our lunch stop:

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-sheep1.jpg">}}](/img/blog/2013-08/iceland-sheep1.jpg)


** Next time? **

This time, we've mostly been to the north and some major attractions around Reykjavik. Did not see any glaciers up close, nor anything that is in the south or middle. I guess that's left for the next time(s).

Most of the photos above shot by my wife Aistė. I'll just end the post with this picture. *BAA!*
