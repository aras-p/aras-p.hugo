Yesterday Paulius put screenshots from [UE3](http://unrealtechnology.com/html/technology/ue30.shtml) and our demo next to each other, wrote "right!" and "wrong!" over the corresponding shots and we realized that we're basically screwed.

In the evening, I tweaked lighting and contrast, made some lightmaps and hand-drawn the other lightmaps.

In the morning, Paulius took new screenshots and put UE3 screenshots next to them. Then he wrote "WTF?" over UE3 ones and "world domination!" over ours. Suddenly we realized that maybe it ain't that bad afterall.

Conclusion: it all depends on what's written over the screenshots :)
