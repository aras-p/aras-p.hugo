_I'm not dead yet! :)_

A pretty busy time it is. Real actual work at work (!), writing "storyboard" for our ImagineCup demo (required, deadline April 1st) and that game I'm working for as a contractor. I wish there were less jobs at the same time, right now I'd sacrifice the game work...

On the good side, looks like my demogroup has won the [scene.org award](http://awards.scene.org/pastawards.php?year=2004) for "breakthrough performance" (that means "best newcommer of the year" or something like that). I wasn't at the awards ceremony in [Breakpoint'05](http://breakpoint.untergrund.net/), oh well. Maybe next time :)
