So I went and put the sourcecode of our engine and the current (in progress) demo at BerliOS, so far only the [Subversion tree](http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=3515) (browse it online [here](http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/dingus/)).

The 'engine', called **dingus** _(don't ask me why :))_, is the one that was born for [LTGameJam2003](http://jammy.sourceforge.net/2003/index.php), based on some previous experience and insights from people more clever than me. Variations of it were used in all 'serious' [nesnausk!](http://www.nesnausk.org/projects.php) demos so far, and in my personal projects as well. The sourcetree at BerliOS has no exporters/tools commited in yet, that will be at some later time. Of course, no real documentation is written for the engine.

Besides the engine, there's **ic2005** project that's, well, the sourcecode for our WIP demo for ImagineCup2005. No art assets in any form are committed in, sorry :)

At some later time I'll put the sourcecode for our other demos/projects as well. Maybe.

_Update_: mesh and animation exporters for 3dsMax added to svn. Other tools pending.
