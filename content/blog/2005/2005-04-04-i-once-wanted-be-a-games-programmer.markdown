Some 6-8 years ago I'd think hey, _games programming is all I want to do_. Right now I'm more on the _"let's see"_ side.

One thing is: I don't really play games. Last time I _seriously_ played a game was, like, 7 years ago (IIRC). Some of the modern games I've _seen or tried_ a bit  are HalfLife2, Doom3, DungeonSiege, GTA3 and... that's all! Wanting to be a game developer when you're not really interested in games would be pretty weird, right?

Right now I'd think that my main interest is (realtime) computer graphics. I know that sounds pretty familiar - everyone starts from doing rendering engine - but hey, I'm still interested in CG now, and my first attempt at it was ~9 years ago, a mosaic-drawing-program on ZX Spectrum...

Would I want to work on a game? It depends. I don't really like the current state of the industry at large; and working on something that's not directly a game (like at IHV, or middleware, or research) would probably be more interesting.

I guess that's why I'm trying not to work fulltime and leave some time for demoscene and similar stuff. _Ok, my daughter has got the scissors somehow and now is trying to cut some books. Gotta go :)_
