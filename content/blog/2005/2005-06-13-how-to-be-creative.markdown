Another day I stumbled upon this: [how to be creative](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html). Overall it's good; although a bit too long and most of the content is quite common-sense. A good read anyway.

That reminds me: the other day I was thinking about a strange feeling in the town where I live (Kaunas, Lithuania). Basically, whenever I see a group (three or more) of young guys (20-25), most of the time they seem to be aggressive and angry. I don't get this feeling in the other towns/cities; I don't really know what's causing it. Maybe it's several bad experiences I had. Some of my friends have this feeling also, so it can't be just my problem.

I wonder why people are agressive at all. I mean, what's the point in insulting/pushing/beating a random walker-by? Is that the only way they can express or "feel" themselves - through invoking fear or pain on the others? Maybe; another day I read Jean-Paul Sartre's "The Childhood of the Leader" (_L'enfance d'un chef_) and maybe that's the case - when a person can't find "himself" he starts doing weird things.

Still, why there seems to be so many of them?
