Writing thesis at the university is weird, you have to write 50 pages of poo just to present 5 pages of useful information. Introductions, overviews, previous works, aims, hopes, discussions, explanations of unrelated stuff etc.

I have a temptation to put a small picture of some dragon (or worse) somewhere inside just to test if anyone really reads that crap.
