Work has really started on the next version of [Project Hoshimi](/projHoshimi.html) for Microsoft. We've got to:


  
  * Add eye candy, whatever that may be. They say we can ditch some old harware (DX6 level), but methinks we can't go really wild ("minimum ps2.0" would be cool, but not in this real world). We've got to add some particles, transparent blood cells, lighting fx etc. Anyone has some ideas what could be easy to implement and look extremely cool? :)
  
  
  * I can't say much, but it's about network, client-server etc. Time to learn some network programming for me!
  
  * The guys behind whole this thing have some really insane plans that would rock the christ child if they would really happen. Not a high probability of them happening though...
Ok, back to thinking about possible eye candy and the network protocol.
