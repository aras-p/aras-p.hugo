There's a [news item on next-gen.biz](http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10570&Itemid=2) on Plastic's [Linger in Shadows](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=50170) PS3 demo.

What is totally amazing, is that the news item does actually _make sense_. It does not treat the demo as a game, or as some "what the f?" thing. Kudos.

About the demo itself - I totally dig the insane amount of work put in there; but I was quite confused with "story" or "meaning". The visuals are good, the tech is good, it is impressive, but the message of the demo I just did not get. But still great work, go Plastic!
