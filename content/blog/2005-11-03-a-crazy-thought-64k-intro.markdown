I was planning to do a demo this year; all by myself (except music). However, after playing with [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) a bit it became clear that I am really not a 3D artist (not Blender's fault, of course) - what a surprise :)

Now a crazy thought: do a 64 kilobyte intro instead?

Yeah, I know, one pretty unsuccessful [try](http://aras-p.info/projBzhykt.html) already was there 3+ years ago... But still: I need a musician that could use Farbrausch's [V2 synth](http://1337haxorz.de/products.html#v2), some clever ideas/design/code and there it is. There's a hope that I have actually learned something in these 3 years, you know :)

By the way, this bzhykt intro produces really abstract visuals on my computer right now. Something was messed up in there...
