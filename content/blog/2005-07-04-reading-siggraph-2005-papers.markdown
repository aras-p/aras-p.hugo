I'm reading Siggraph 2005 preprint papers that are nicely gathered [here](http://www.cs.brown.edu/%7Etor/sig2005.html). Some of them are really amazing! What I'm impressed with so far:

[Texture Montage](http://research.microsoft.com/users/kunzhou/): looks cool. Just made me realize how primitive the "usual" texturing tools are... It makes me want to create some texturing tool...

[LDPRT](http://research.microsoft.com/%7Eppsloan/) and [Local PRT](http://graphics.ucsd.edu/papers/plrt/) are steps in the needed direction for precomputed radiance transfer. Though [Ignacio](http://castano.ludicon.com/) says that CPCA compression of SH is patented my M$... Bah!

[Relational Debugging for the Graphics Pipeline](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/%7Ecohen/publications.html) is like NVPerfHud on steroids!
