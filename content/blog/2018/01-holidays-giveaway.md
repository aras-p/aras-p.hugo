I told the internet I'd buy books and stuff for people, and you won't believe what happened next!

45 people got books and stuff.

*FIN*.


#### Backstory

I wrote this on both [mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@aras/99178536487529963) and
[twitter](https://twitter.com/aras_p/status/941653711218270208):

> Let's try some "we'll probably make it through 2017" gifts. Do you need a book, a course,

> ping me and I'll try to do it!

Why? Dunno, sounded like that would be a nice thing to do. And then I got two requests, which I fulfilled,
and then... nothing. However, I repeated the same thing the next day, during a more US-friendly hour,
and then the requests started flowing in.


#### Expectations

This being the internet, I expected totally *random* and *weird* things. A million requests, a bunch of trolls,
a bunch of nonsense, etc.

I'm happy to report that the internet managed to pleasantly surprise me in how well it behaved in this particular
occasion!


#### Requests

In the end I gave gifts to 45 strangers on the internet before calling it a day, and here's what they turned
out to be.

Unsurprisingly enough, majority were something about computers.

* 13 books: 11 on programming, 2 on art/design.
* 5 courses or tutorials: 3 on programming, 2 on art.
* 9 items of physical hardware: a couple of Raspberry Pi 3s, leapmotion, 360 camera, daydream VR viewer etc.
* 4 software licenses: Git Tower (twice), Gamemaker Studio 2, ArtStation Pro.

Of course, the most interesting requests are those that are *not* computer related :)

Was really surprised by amount of people saying "I don't need anything myself, but if you could donate to
charity/nonprofit X that would be great". 13% of all requests being of that kind is pretty sweet! For some of
the requests I decided to go for a larger than $50-$100 contribution. Here's what people asked to donate to:

* [National Multiple Sclerosis Society](https://www.nationalmssociety.org/)
* [Kiva Microfunds](https://www.kiva.org/)
* [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)
* [Surfrider Foundation](https://www.surfrider.org/)
* [Scarecrow Video](http://blog.scarecrow.com/about-us-3/)
* Patreon for a graphics/comics artist

And of course, "everything else" is where it was fairly random. I bought tree saplings, socks,
room heater, covered an electricity bill, vet expenses and so on. Very interesting!


#### Tips and Findings

* Buying stuff for strangers on the internet is easiest via Amazon wishlists. I pretty much got this
  ready-to-paste for inquiries: *"Can you create a wishlist on Amazon, add the item to it, setup a
  shipping address and give me the link?"* One big advantage -- it does not disclose actual address, phone or 
  other personal details to me; and overall it's way easier than filling in whole shipping forms.
* Keep on mind though that for each and every new shipping address, Amazon will ask you to re-enter your credit
  card details. This makes sense for security purposes, but in this particular scenario it means re-entering
  them *each.and.every.time*. Your own Amazon UI for shipping address choices will become a mess in the end as well,
  and will need some cleanup.
* Shipping costs are very real! Both you & me probably have a *"oh yeah, a book is like $50"* mental image,
  but depending on where it needs to be shipped that can end up anywhere in $50 to $100 for the same book.
* Time investment wise, I probably have spent 15-20 hours on all this, during evenings over a few days.
  With some people it took quite a few roundtrips of back & forth messaging until I got a concrete actionable
  thing (URL of a thing: actionable, "I want a book I saw last week": not so much :)).
  Maybe next time it would be easier, given that *now* I know I should just tell people "yo, gimmeh your amazon
  wishlist" fast-track.

It was quite a lot of fun and felt good! If you have money to spare, I can definitely recommend.
