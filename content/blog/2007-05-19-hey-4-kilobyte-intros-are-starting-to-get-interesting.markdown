Is it just me, or 4k intros really evolved by leaps and bounds in the last few years? I remember the time when 4k stuff was like "ok, that's cool for a 4k" - but if it weren't four kilobytes, nobody would watch it. Then in around 2004 came [Yellow Rose of Texas](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=10562), [San Angeles Observation](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=13020) and [Micropolis](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=13017) - and they were beautiful and interesting by themselves already. In case of Micropolis, it has a city and a big robot - who  can resist that? The fact that they are in 4 kilobytes makes that even more interesting.

Fast forward to 2007. _Of course_ every decent 4k intro has music now. Some do have separate scenes, with greets and stuff like "the real demos" ([sprite-o-mat](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=30222)). Others have ambient occlusion and interesting lighting ([Galiwm](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=30202), [kinderplomber](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=30204)). Some have raytracing in the pixel shaders ([4kmdr](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=30540)). And so on.

Woo-hoo! I expect the 4k scene to bring some real jewels in the next couple of years.
