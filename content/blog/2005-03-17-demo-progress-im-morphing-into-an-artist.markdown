I'm slowly becoming a non-programmer. I'm UV-mapping the meshes, welding the vertices, exporting and importing back and forth and computing normal/AO maps. I'll probably even go and code some procedural material shaders in the next couple of days. That's weird, nobody's doing real programming at the moment; the code part is seriously lagging behind.

We should have had _(is that proper English?)_ the wall fracture+physics by now and some of the interactive mode character controls (animation blending etc.). Alas, none of that right now.

In the picture there's a fragment of wall decorations and it's object space normal map (just to add more colors). The texture, gloss map and some real lighting isn't there yet.
