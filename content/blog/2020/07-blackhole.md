*I made a demo with my kid, and it somehow managed to get 1st place at a (small) demoparty!*

The story of this demo started around year 2006 (!). I had just started working at Unity
in Copenhagen, and was renting a tiny room (it was like 12 square meters; back then that's
all I could afford). The guy I was renting from was into writing
and music. One of his stories was narrated into a music track, and that's what I wanted
to make a demo from... so we agreed that I would make a demo, using his story & music for it.

> go [check it out](https://open.spotify.com/album/2jtZMLk1PbU5ckYRe9cdeE).

And... I never made the demo with that soundtrack.

Until sometime in 2018, during one week of vacation, I sat down with my kid and we decided
to try to make it. A bunch of sketching, planning and experimenting with fractals followed.

And then the vacation week was over, and Regular Life happened again. I only came back to fiddle
a bit with the demo sometime in 2019.

And then... *(hmm is there a pattern here?)* that got parked again. Until now, mid-2020, I had another
vacation week with nothing much to do. So here it is! Wrapped it up, submitted to [Field-FX](https://field-fx.party/)
demoparty, and somehow managed to get 1st place \o/

#### Tech Details

It's a Unity 2018.2 project with nothing fancy really. A timeline,
and mostly raymarched fractals that render into the g-buffer. Some utilities
I've used from the most excellent [Keijiro's github](https://github.com/keijiro),
and the fractals are based on "[Kali Sets](https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/04/kalisets-and-hybrid-ducks/)",
particularly "[kalizyl and kalizul](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtlGR2)" shadertoy by Stefan Berke.
