I'll be speaking at [i3D Symposium](http://i3dsymposium.org) and [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) in San Francisco in a couple of days.

At i3D, **Industry Panel** (Sunday at 11:00AM). [Jason Mitchell](https://twitter.com/pixelmaven) (Valve) will do a panel on the scalability challenges inherent in shipping games on a diverse range of platforms. Panelists are Michael Bukowski (Vicarious Visions), [Jeremy Shopf](https://twitter.com/rgbaxyzw) (Firaxis), [Emil Persson](https://twitter.com/_Humus_) (Avalanche) and yours truly.

*My first i3D, can't wait to see what it is about!*

At GDC, a bunch of talks on Tuesday:

* **[Practical Techniques for Ray Tracing in Games](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828113)** (11:15-12:15). Will show quite an interesting take on where raytracing is useful in game production.
* **[Advanced Lighting Techniques in Unity](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828194)** (13:45-14:45). Some upcoming sweet, sweet lighting related stuff.
* **[Bringing Console Quality Lighting to Mobile](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828124)** (15:00-16:00). Peter McGuinness' (Imagination) discussion panel with Victor Bernot (Gameloft), [Timothy Lottes](https://twitter.com/TimothyLottes) (Epic Games), [James McCombe](https://twitter.com/McCombeJA) (Imagination) and myself.
* **[Physically Based Shading in Unity](http://schedule.gdconf.com/session-id/828194)** (16:00-17:00). Shaders and all related things that fall out of that. This is something I've been working on for a while by now, will be nice to show that publicly.

The Unity tracks will probably get a shorter repeat at [Unity expo booth](http://unity3d.com/company/events/gdc/2014) on Wednesday.

See you there!
