Switched to the new job recently. So here I am, sitting in OTEE office in Copenhagen, working on [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) game development tool. Not exactly game development, but quite related. So far so good, will see how it goes. If you haven't yet - take a look at Unity, it is good and will only get better.
