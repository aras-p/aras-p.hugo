If I ever see code that I think could be written in 'much better' way, I have a really big temptation to rewrite/refactor it. Sometimes this can be good, eg. when I spot buggy code. Sometimes it depends, as I often spot the code that is _(or I think is)_ 'sub-obtimal'.

The worst situation is when the code **is** buggy, but some other part of the codebase **depends** on that code being buggy. If you find one, and not the other, it's bad.

Working on some big unknown codebase remotely (I'm a contractor for one game in development) makes this worse. I must resist the temptation to alter the code, no matter how bad it looks...
