Aaargh! Well, the blog title is about as much as I wanted to say on this topic.

...this is just me venting out, during the process of chasing a video memory leak for 4 days already. It involves p-buffers, depth textures, shared OpenGL contexts and other delicious things. Still didn't find the cause, but I'm getting close.

Pbuffer my a**.
