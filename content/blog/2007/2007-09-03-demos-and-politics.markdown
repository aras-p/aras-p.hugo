A demo with a political statement: [Ultimatum to the World: First Days of the Last War](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=31735) by mfx.

This is good because it _has_ a statement; and we need works that say things that matter. To quote [Naomi Klein's speech](http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/08/16/3219/):



> Do you want to tackle climate change as much as Dick Cheney wants Kazakhstanâ€™s oil? Do you? Do you want universal healthcare as much as Paris Hilton wants to be the next new face of Estee Lauder? If not, why not? What is wrong with us? Where is our passionate intensity?



So respect to mfx for making a demo with a statement. We need more of those. I don't have enough passion to say things that matter to me; maybe someday I will.

That said, the demo itself is not _that_ good. Whereas in [The Ballet Dancer](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=19023) the final "now that everything is lost..." was a culmination of the whole demo, here in Ultimatum to the World the famous Einstein quote does not work at all. Maybe the quote is just too well known.
