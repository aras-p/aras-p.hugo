[{{<imgright src="http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/megapixel-3normal.thumbnail.jpg" title="'Megapixel!'">}}](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/megapixel-3normal.jpg)I just have to blog this: shockwave.com just launched a Unity web game - [MegaPixel](http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/megapixel.jsp). It's a pure, abstract, and mega-fun FPS. It's set up in a very small space (the levels are basically boxes with several smaller boxes inside), and it pretty much uses a single texture for the whole game, and it does not use much more than particle effects for _everything_ (the levels, enemies, weapons and everything else is just particles). Pure genius.

I like it! That says a lot, because last time I played FPS was _ages_ ago. Finally, someone made a game that I can like again. _How much I'm biased because it's made with Unity... decide for yourselves :)_

Now the killer part: the game is designed and developed solely by a 15 year old - [Forest "Yoggy" Johnson](http://yogware.bluegillstudios.com/site/). How cool is that?

Enough talking, just go and [play it](http://www.shockwave.com/gamelanding/megapixel.jsp). And remember that you didn't see cool until you get to the robot level!
