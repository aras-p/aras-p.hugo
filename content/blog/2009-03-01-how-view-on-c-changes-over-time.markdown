It's funny how one's view on things change over time.

Back in 2002, I [wrote](http://aras-p.info/relyzai00.html) something that would be roughly translated like "C++ amazes me more and more". In a positive sense! And I was talking about what is [Boost.Spirit](http://spirit.sourceforge.net/) now.

A [reply](http://www.gamedev.lt/viewtopic.php?p=19644#p19644) on local game development forums I wrote today (again, rough translation): "C++ is very hard and quite a horrible language, maybe you should not use it unless there are no alternatives".

That's quite a change in attitude we have here!

I feel like much of C++ horrors are a consequence of "it just somehow happened" (the whole template metaprogramming thing) or as a backwards compatibility with C requirement. Or maybe not, but I do agree with what [ryg says here](https://mollyrocket.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1955#1955). Let's play the internet memes:
