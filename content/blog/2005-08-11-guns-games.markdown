The comment on the blog entry [here](http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=422) is great:


> 38% of Americans own game consoles. Around 40% of Americans own guns. The gun lobby is damn powerful. We shouldn't need anywhere near as much money as the gun lobby, because unlike games, we are absolutely, 100% sure that guns actually _do_ kill people.
