I booted into Vista yesterday to test something. It offered a bunch of updates to install. After they were installed, I got this:

[![Invincible buttons](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/invincibleshutdown.jpg)](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/invincibleshutdown.jpg)

I am not sure what shutdown buttons do when they look like this. I guess they are invincible, or something. _Ha, I'm your log off button! You can't kill me!_

Yes, one of the updates installed was the ATI driver update, so I _guess_ there's some glitch _somewhere_ in the driver update that makes _some buttons_ be displayed like this... But hey, this is not some random driver that I found on the net, it's the one that is officially suggested by Vista's update!
