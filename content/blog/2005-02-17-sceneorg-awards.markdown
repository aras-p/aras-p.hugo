Woohoo! My demogroup is [nominated](http://awards.scene.org/nominees.php?cat=8) to scene.org awards 2004, in 'breakthrough performance'! Pretty cool, considering that [Syntonic Dentiforms](http://aras-p.info/projSynDent.html), which we got nominated for, is my first 'real' attempt at making a demo... _Well, there were other attempts before, but they were really lame and childish :)_

I was pretty happy with my demo-related performance last year. Three demos in half a year _(ok, one of them was crappy)_. Now it's already half a year with no demos, and I already want to make one. Well, I'm already trying to make one, but so far there's lots of higher priority stuff surrounding me.
