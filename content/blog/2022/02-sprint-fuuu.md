Some days ago I noticed that on a Mac, doing `snprintf` calls from multiple threads shows
curious lack of scaling ([see tweet](https://twitter.com/aras_p/status/1496489672373063682)). 
Replacing `snprintf` with [{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/) library can speed up the OBJ exporter
in Blender 3.2 by 3-4 *times*. This could have been the end of the story, filed under a 
"eh, sprintf is bad!" drawer, but I started to wonder _why_ it shows this lack of scaling.

### Test case

A simple test: convert two million integers into strings. And then try to do the same on multiple
threads at once, i.e. each thread converts the same two million integers. If the number of threads
is below the number of CPU cores, this *should* take about the same time -- each thread would just
happily be converting their own numbers, and not interfere with the other threads.

And here's what happens on an Apple M1 Max laptop *(vertical axis is log scale)*:

Converting two million numbers into strings takes 100 milliseconds when one CPU core is doing it.
When all eight "performance" cores are doing it, it takes 1.8 seconds, or **18 times as long**.
That's, _like_, not great!

### Yo dude, you should not use sprintf

*"Well duh"* you say, *"obviously you should not use sprintf, you should use C++ iostreams"*. Okay.
Here's converting integers into strings via a `std::stringstream <<`.

Same scaling issue, except iostreams are two times slower. "Zero cost abstractions", you know :)

### What's going on?

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-mac-profile.png">}}](/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-mac-profile.png)

[Instruments](https://help.apple.com/instruments) shows that with 8 threads, each thread spends over 90%
of the time in something called `localeconv_l`, where it is mostly mutex locks.

At this point you might be thinking, *"ah-ha! well this is related to a locale, and a locale is global, so of
course some time spent on some mutex lock is expected"*, which is *"mmmaybe? but this amount of time feels
excessive?"*. Given that this is an Apple operating system, we might know it has a
[`snprintf_l` function](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/snprintf_l.3.html)
which takes an explicit locale, and hope that this would make it scale. Just pass NULL which means
"use C locale":
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-mac-snprintf_l.png">}}](/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-mac-snprintf_l.png)

...aaand, nope. It is a *tiny* bit faster, but does not really address the issue.

But! Large parts of macOS Darwin kernel and system libraries have source code available, so
let's look at what's going on. Here's the latest `localeconv_l` at the time of writing:
[github link](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Libc/blob/d0bbfb749/locale/FreeBSD/localeconv.c#L121).
It's basically a:
```c
lconv* localeconv_v(locale_t loc)
{
    lock_on(loc);
    if (loc->something_changed)
    {
        // do some stuff
    }
    unlock_on(loc);
    // ...
}
```
and the lock used internally is just a `os_unfair_lock` macOS primitive. What is curious, is that this code
has *very recently* [changed](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Libc/commit/d0bbfb749a6116512756d9c65922d725e9863495#diff-083c7c975ba1dc50e8c14c44653f54f61b1a8cda32bd596d0fb570211e54fdccR121); before 2022 February
it was like:
```c
lconv* localeconv_v(locale_t loc)
{
    if (loc->something_changed)
    {
        lock_on(loc);
        if (loc->something_changed)
        {
            // do some stuff
        }
        unlock_on(loc);        
    }
    // ...
}
```
Which to me *feels like* the previous code was trying to do a "[double checked locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-checked_locking)"
pattern, but without using actual atomic memory reads. Which *probably* happens to work just fine on Intel CPUs, but *might* be more problematic
elsewhere, like maybe on Apple's own CPUs? And then someone decided to just always take that mutex lock, instead of investigating
possible use of atomic operations.

Now, Apple's OS is BSD-based, so we can check what other BSD based systems do.
* [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD) does not have any mutexes there, and before 2021 September was just checking a flag.
  Since then, the flag check [was changed](https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/commit/7eb138a9e5363) to use atomic operations.
* [OpenBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD) does not use any atomics or mutexes at all, and the "has something changed?" flag is
  not even per-locale, it's just a [global variable](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/558b4987cd/lib/libc/locale/localeconv.c#L26). YOLO!

So given all this knowledge, presumably, if each thread used a *physically different* locale object *and* `snprintf_l`, then it
would scale fine. And it does:

### What else can we do?

Now, besides the old `snprintf` and `std::stringstream`, there are other things we can do. For example:

* [stb_sprintf](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_sprintf.h), a trivial to integrate, public domain C library
  that is a full sprintf replacement, but without any locale specific stuff. It's also presumably faster, smaller and works the
  same across different compilers/platforms.
* [{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/), a MIT-licensed C++ library "providing a fast and safe alternative to C stdio and C++ iostreams". {fmt}
  was a base for C++20 formatting additions.
* Not a general replacement, but if we only need to turn numbers into strings, C++17 has
  [to_chars](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/to_chars).

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-mac.png">}}](/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-mac.png)

All of those scale with increased thread usage just fine, and all of them are way faster in single threaded case too.
{fmt} looks very impressive. Yay!


### Is this all Apple/Mac specific?

Let's try all the above things on Windows with Visual Studio 2022. This one supports more things compared to clang 13 that I have
on a Mac:

* There is C++20 [formatting library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format) with `format_to_n`. This uses the same
  type safe syntax as {fmt} library, and we can hope it would be of a similar performance and scaling.
* Similar to BSD-specific `snprintf_l`, Visual Studio has its own
  [`_snprintf_l`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/snprintf-snprintf-snprintf-l-snwprintf-snwprintf-l?view=msvc-170).
* Speaking of not-so-general solutions, Visual Studio also has `itoa` to convert integers into strings.

[{{<img src="/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-win-vs2022.png">}}](/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-win-vs2022.png)

* Unlike the Mac case, just the regular `snprintf` does not have the multi-threaded scaling issue! It takes around 100 milliseconds
  for two million integers, no matter how many threads are doing it at the same time.
* C++ `stringstream` performance and scaling is *really bad*. It starts being 4x slower than snprintf at one thread, and goes up
  to be **hundred times slower** at 8 threads.
* The new, hot, C++20 based formatting functionality using `format_to_n` is *really bad* too! It *starts* being 10x slower than snprintf (!),
  and goes to be 40x slower at 8 threads.

Ok, what is going on *here*?! [Superluminal profiler](https://superluminal.eu/) to the rescue, and here's what it says:

The `stringstream`, in one thread case, ends up spending most of the time in the infamous "zero-cost abstractions" of C++ :) A bunch of
function calls, a tiny bit of work here and there, and then somewhere deep inside it ends up calling `snprintf` anyway. Just all around
that, tiny bits and pieces of cost all add up. In the 8 threads case, it ends up spending all the time inside mutex locks, quite
similar to how Mac/Apple case was doing. Just here it's C++, so it ends up being *worse* - there's not a single mutex lock, but rather
what looks like three mutex locks on various parts of the locale object (via `std::use_facet` of different bits), *and* then there's
also reference counting, with atomic increase/decrease operations smashing the same locale object.

The `format_to_n`, in one thread case, ends up spending all the time in... ü•Å... Loading resource files.
*[:WAT:](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)* Each and every call
*"plz turn this integer into a string"* ends up doing:
* Create something called a `_Fmt_codec` object, which
* Calls `__std_get_cvt`, which
* Figures out "information about installed or available code page" via [`GetCPInfoExW`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getcpinfoexw), which
* Ends up calling `FindResourceExW` and `LoadResource` on something. Which then call `LdrpLoadResourceFromAlternativeModule` and `LdrpAccessResourceDataNoMultipleLanguage` and so on and so on.

In the 8 threads case, that is all the same, except all that resource loading is presumably on the same "thing", so it ends up
spending a ton of time deep inside the OS kernel doing `MiLockVadShared`, and `MiUnlockAndDereferenceVadShared`, and
`LOCK_ADDRESS_SPACE_SHARED` and so on.

So *that* is something I would not have expected to see, to be honest. Curiously enough, there is a similar sounding
issue on Github of Microsoft's STL, which is [marked resolved](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/issues/1825) since 2021 April.

And no, usual Internet advice of "MSVC sucks, use Clang" does not help in this particular case.
Using Clang 13, the C++20 formatting library is not available
yet, but otherwise all other options look pretty much the same, including the disappointing performance of stringstream:

### What about Linux?

I only have an Ubuntu 20 install via WSL2 here to test, and using the default compilers there (clang 10 and gcc 9.3),
things look pretty nice:\
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-linux-clang.png" width="350px">}}](/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-linux-clang.png)
[{{<img src="/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-linux-gcc.png" width="350px">}}](/img/blog/2022/sprint-fuuu-linux-gcc.png)

C++20 format library is not available in either of these compilers to test, but everything else scales really well with increased
thread count. {fmt} continues to be impressive there as well.


### Conclusion

Would you have expected a "turn an integer into a string" routine to be loading resource file information blocks from some library,
for *each and every call*? Yeah, me neither.

Technically, there are no *bugs* anywhere above - all the functions work *correctly*, as far as standard is concerned. But some of them
have interesting (lack of) multi-core scaling behavior, some others have just regular performance overheads compared to others, etc.

If you need to target multiple different compilers & platforms, *and* want consistent performance characteristics, then avoiding
some parts of C or C++ standard libraries might be one way. Or at least, *do not assume anything* about performance (and especially about
multi-thread scaling) characteristics of the standard libraries.

If you need to do string formatting in C++, I can highly recommend using [{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/).
