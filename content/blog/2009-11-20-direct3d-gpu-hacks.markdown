I'm catching up on various GPU hacks that exist for Direct3D 9 (things like native shadow mapping, render to vertex buffer, etc.). Turns out there's a lot of them, but all the information is scattered around the intertubes.

So here are the [**D3D9 hacks known to me in one place**](http://aras-p.info/texts/D3D9GPUHacks.html).

Let me know if I missed something or got something wrong. I also want to figure out if Intel GPUs/drivers implement any of them.
