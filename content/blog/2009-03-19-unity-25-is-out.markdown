Unity 2.5 is finally released. In summary:

[![Unity 2.5](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/unity25-500x241.jpg)](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/unity25.jpg)

Here's [what's new](http://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-2.5). Here's the [download page](http://unity3d.com/unity/download).

My 11th Unity release since I joined [3+ years ago](/blog/2006/01/10/switched-jobs-almost-back-in-this-crazy-industry/). This is quite a crazy release that involved _almost complete_ editor tools rewrite and lots of other juggling. Was not exactly a walk in the park, but it's done now. Meet me at [GDC in San Francisco](http://www.gdconf.com/) next week and I'll tell you the war stories (Unity booth is 5110 NH).

Here's the obligatory source code commits graph:

[![2.5 svn commits](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/25commits-500x170.png)](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/25commits.png)

18 people involved in source code, 5315 commits, 18501 file changes. Of course, svn commits do not _mean_ anything... I'm just fascinated by graphs and numbers.
