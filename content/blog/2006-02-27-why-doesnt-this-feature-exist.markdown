Found this quote from [Raymond Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing) today ([here](http://blog.ryjones.org/2005/07/12/Product+Development.aspx)):


> The answer to "Why doesn't this feature exist?" is usually "By default features don't exist. Somebody has to implement them."
>
> It's not like every feature you can think of comes out of your brain fully tested and implemented, and then some PM somewhere files a bug to have your feature removed.  Features start out nonexistent and somebody has to make them happen.


So brilliant.
