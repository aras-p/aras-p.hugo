Ok, seems like Microsoft Lithuania issues some PR about ImagineCup and [our demo](http://nesnausk.org/inoutside) in there, and now every news portal in Lithuania catched it.

Now, its pretty standard in a sense that from the PR itself noone could understand what it's about. The "rendering competition" is translated into something that means "the competition of presenting ideas"; and the demo is described as a "CG short film". And, of course, the usual press-like exaggerations: "competed with 17000 students and took 1/2 place" - which is obviously wrong as 17k is the total number of students; in the rendering compo there was probably something like 100.

I don't like it (the press); it's just a noise that distracts you. Meh.

One funny thing: yesterday I received a call into work phone from one local PR agency. How the hell do they get this information? They know my name and university (it's in the press release) - how do they find out where I work and more, how do they get my phone number? I mean, even _I don't know my work phone number_ (ok, I could find it out if I needed)!
