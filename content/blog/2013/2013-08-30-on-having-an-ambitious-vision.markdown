title: On having an ambitious vision

We just announced upcoming [2D tools](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2013/08/28/unity-native-2d-tools/) for Unity 4.3, and one of responses I've seen is *"I am rapidly running out of reasons not to use Unity"*. Which reminds me of some stories of a few years back.

Perhaps sometime in 2006, I was eating shawarmas with [Joachim](https://www.google.com/search?q=joachim+ante) and discussing possible futures of Unity. His answer to my question, *"so what's your ultimate goal with Unity"* was along the lines of,

> I want to make it so that whenever **anyone** starts making a game, Unity will be their first choice of tech.

Of course that was crazy talk, so my reaction was somewhere between *"you know that's going to be hard"* and *"good luck with that"*. Fast forward to 2013 and the thought is not so crazy anymore. Of course not *everyone* has to use Unity, but quite many do consider and use it. My slightly pessimistic, pragmatic, probability-weighted thinking proved wrong.

Some time before that, in late 2005, I got an email from some [David](https://www.google.com/search?q=david+helgason), asking if I'd want to join their company I've never heard about. The company made this engine, "Unity", that I've never heard about; and it was Mac-only, and I've only *seen* a Mac before.

The email said:

Now, **that was 2005**. Unity was at version 1.1. No one besides [Jon Czeck](https://twitter.com/JonathanCzeck) was probably using it; more or less.

Crazy fantasies from someone who's somewhere between naïve and delusional? Yeah, sounds like it. So *of course* after a couple of exhanges I said "no" (but then they invited me to a gamejam, and I thought that while most likely nothing big will happen out of that, at least it will be fun...).

And now it's 2013. And no matter if you like or dislike Unity, there's no denying it is quite a thing, and perhaps changed the industry for better. A tiny bit at least. These crazy, ambitious ideas did come through.

Reminder for myself: probabilities and pragmatism do not always win. Gotta have goals that are beyond practical possibilities.
