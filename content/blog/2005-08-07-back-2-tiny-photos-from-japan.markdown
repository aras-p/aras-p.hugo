Left to right, top to bottom: The fractal house on our way from Narita Airport to Yokohama. Visual Gaming competition in action - hey, it's the 3D viewer I wrote! Paulius in the ferri wheel - demo or die. Me showing our demo before the dinner. The wistful photo - me looking at the horizon. Yokohama - we were here.
