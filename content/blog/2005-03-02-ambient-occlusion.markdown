Ambient occlusion is really cool. Yeah, precalculated occlusion for animating objects is fake, but with some hacks it's still very cool. Why I didn't use it before? :)Here, a small shot comparing no-AO with AO _(super small because it's still work-in-progress, I'm not sure if my teammates would be very happy with me showing big screens :))_.

Ah, at the bottom there are "my" soft shadows that I've written about earlier, but nothing can be seen in such a small shot. Oh well; shadows will be the story for another day.
