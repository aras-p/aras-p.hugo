[GDC2005](http://www.gdconf.com/) is over now and everyone's crazy about Will Wright's Spore (see [GameSpy](http://www.gamespy.com/articles/595/595975p1.html?fromint=1) or [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050315/postcard-diamante.htm)), it's procedural content generation etc. Heh, the demoscene still matters :)

On the other hand, we suck. Our to-be-done demo will have what: normal mapping, AO, shadowmaps, postprocessing fx; all the stuff that everyone and their grandmother has. It's like lens-flares and envmaps some years ago. We're as innovative as a coffee cup.

_k, back to work..._
