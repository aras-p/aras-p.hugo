<p><em>Everything here is work in progress!</em></p>

<p>This is a game for <a href="http://lostgarden.com/2008/06/shade-game-design-challenge.html">Lost Garden's Shade design challenge</a>.</p>

<h3>Playable builds</h3>

<p>All builds are in-browser and require <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity-web-player-2.x">Unity Web Player</a>
to be installed (it will prompt for download if not installed). Windows 2000+ or Mac OS X 10.3.9+ is needed,
and the game requires a graphics card that can render proper shadows (most pixel shader 2.0+ cards will do, except
Intel GMA 950 on Windows).</p>

<p><a href="files/shadushrooms/shadushrooms03.html"><strong>2008 07 31</strong></a> - oh my, did absolutely nothing during whole July...
Here's some small stuff:
	<ul>
	<li>game area larger, camera follows the player</li>
	<li>minimap</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><a href="files/shadushrooms/shadushrooms02.html"><strong>2008 07 02</strong></a> - spent a little more time on it.
No tuning of the gameplay yet, just small bits.
	<ul>
	<li>improved following of the player</li>
	<li>mushrooms will go to homebase as soon as player touches it</li>
	<li>reduced speed of player & mushroom growth (does not feel right yet; I think at least they should shrink much faster)</li>
	<li>more complex level</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><a href="files/shadushrooms/shadushrooms01.html"><strong>2008 06 30</strong> - <em>very</em> initial stage</a>.
Arrow keys to control the player (gray cylinder). Home base is at upper right corner.
Each mushroom follows the player at ever increasing distance, so after a while they start
following at totally wrong distance (hey, it's an early stage!). No daylight change yet.
No "fun factor" of any kind yet either :)
