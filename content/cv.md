### Job experience

#### 2022 - now

Not working anywhere! I am contributing a bit to [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and
several other open source projects. I quite like it so far and not looking for a "real" job :)

#### 2006 - 2021

Code plumber at [**Unity Technologies**](https://unity.com/our-company). Working on
[**Unity**](https://unity.com/) game engine. Empowering developers to create
awesome games and interactive content!

In general I did anything that is needed: editor improvements, internal tools programming,
occasionally leading some small team,
rendering code, shaders, optimizations,
platform specific code, documentation, supporting the customers, reviewing code,
technical guidance for other developers, doing presentations,
creating my own bugs and fixing them, etc. You get the idea.

I've seen the company grow from 3 to 5000+ people, it's quite an amazing thing to watch!

Some of what I've been doing there:

* 2021: Working in a small team focusing on "quality of life" improvements and optimizations across the editor.
* 2020: Leading & mentoring a small team focusing on "quality of life" improvements and optimizations across the editor.
* 2019: Improving Version Control (mostly Perforce) integration in Unity, leading & mentoring a small team. Some build systems work.
* 2018: Internal developer tooling team. Build systems, developer happiness.
* 2017: Shader scalability & features for large productions and scriptable render pipelines, legacy code removal. Also
  stopped doing graphics, moved into internal developer tooling team: build systems, developer happiness.
* 2016: Scriptable render pipelines, various graphics features, optimizations, bug fixing, legacy code removal, code reviews.
* 2015: Frame debugger, graphics command buffers, workflow improvements, management, hiring, bugfixing, janitoring, optimizations, code reviews.
* 2014: New shader import pipeline, physically based shading, deferred shading, iOS Metal renderer, shadow improvements.
* 2013: Mobile shadows, shader compilers/improvements, OpenGL ES 3.0, unity hardware stats, management, 2D (sprite/physics) work.
* 2012: D3D11 renderer, Flash/Stage3D renderer, multithreaded rendering, R&D on demo team, optimizations, fixes, janitoring.
* 2011: Mobile graphics/shader optimizations, various graphics features, shader compiler work, leading graphics team, bugfixes.
* 2010: Graphics engine rewrite; Deferred Lighting; surface shaders; OpenGL ES 2.0 shader translator + optimizer.
* 2009: Unity editor port to Windows, multithreading, Google Chrome support in web plugin, SSAO, Profiler, bug fixes.
* 2008: Terrain+Lighting integration, shader replacement rendering, a lot of bug fixing.
* 2007: Graphics platform abstraction, D3D9 renderer, shadow mapping, optimizations.
* 2006: Windows web plugin, Vista support, misc. graphics work, driver workarounds, performance.


#### 2004 - 2005

Senior software developer at [Alna Software](http://www.alna.com/as).
All kinds of "usual software"; using C++/C#, various databases, CAD systems, document management systems etc.

#### 2005 Feb-Apr
Contractor for _Wireframe Dreams Studios_. Implemented
physics for RTS game _PSI: Syberian Conflict_. C++, ODE physics library with custom tweaks.

#### 2004 Aug-Oct
Contractor for Microsoft; developed 3D viewer for Imagine Cup 2005 Visual Gaming
competition [here](/projHoshimi.html).

#### 2001 - 2004
Researcher & software developer at [InteraMotion LLC](http://www.interamotion.com).

We were almost trying to do what Microsoft did 10 years later with Xbox 360 Kinect:
a system for controlling games by physical motions, driven by cameras observing the player.
We did R&D on the computer vision system, as well as the engine, toolchain and a 3D fighting game.

It didn't really go anywhere though, so we did a bunch of other stuff as well; smaller
computer vision demos, small games and contracting work.

I worked on the computer vision systems, 3dsmax asset exporters, various parts of the engine/toolchain.
Worked mostly with C++, STL/Boost, HLSL, Lua, maxscript.

#### 2000 - 2001

Developer at _Geras Partneris Software_. Web, e-commerce and accounting
projects. Used Java, Swing, J2EE (JBoss), databases, Castor.

#### Spare time

Recent open source projects are [on github](https://github.com/aras-p). Old freetime and non-commercial projects are [**here**](/proj.html). I've been doing various game / graphics stuff since 1994, starting on Sinclair / Atari XE, moving onto PC; and a bit of PlayStation One. Worked alone and with some friends.
