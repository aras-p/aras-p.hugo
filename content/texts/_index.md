[**Hash Function Tests**](/blog/2016/08/09/More-Hash-Function-Tests/) (2016 August)<br/>
Performance tests of various non-cryptographic hash functions, on various CPUs.

[**Direct3D GPU Hacks**](/texts/D3D9GPUHacks.html) (2009 November)<br/>
A list of GPU vendor specific hacks/extensions for D3D9.

[**Compact Normal Storage for small g-buffers**](/texts/CompactNormalStorage.html) (2009 August)<br/>
Various approaches on how to store view space normals in a compact way.

[**Implementing fixed function T&L in vertex shaders**](/texts/VertexShaderTnL.html) (2009 June)<br/>
How to implement the beast in vertex shader 2.0 and up without using HLSL.

[**Oblique Near-Plane Clipping with Orthographic Camera**](/texts/obliqueortho.html) (2007 Nov)<br>
Water and mirrors can live happily with orthographic cameras.

[**Numbers in Transformation Matrices**](/texts/matrices.html) (2007 Apr)<br>
What those 16 numbers actually mean?


[**ShaderX 4**][shaderx4] (2006 Jan) contains two articles of mine:

* _Soft Projected Shadows_ describes shadows in [this](/projInoutside.html).
* _Tips and Tricks for D3DX Effects Based Renderer_, a related part is in state management article below.

[**D3DX Effects State Management**](/texts/d3dx_fx_states.html) (2005 Oct)<br>
An idea and implementation of efficient state management system for D3DX Effects.

**Rendering Soft Shadows in Real-Time** a.k.a. my master's thesis (2005 May)<br/>
Basically, I present two algorithms for rendering (fake) soft shadows in realtime. One is also published in ShaderX 3 (Fake Soft Shadows...),
the other is in [ShaderX 4][shaderx4]. Low quality PDF
of my work is [here](/texts/files/ArasPranckevicius_Magistras_low.pdf) (Lithuanian).

[**ShaderX 3**][shaderx3] (2004 Dec) contains two my articles:

* _Shaderey â€“ NPR Style Rendering_ describes techniques behind [this](/projShaderey.html).
* _Fake Soft Shadows Using Precomputed Visibility Distance Functions_ was part of my master's thesis, maybe some time I'll put some info here.

[**Direct3D Resource Management**](/texts/d3dresources.html) (2004 Sep)<br>
How I did it in several of my demos. So far it even worked!

**Introduction to modern GPU architecture** (2003 Oct, Lithuanian)<br/>
A presentation for the University on modern GPUs, their architecture and programmability features.
[Paper](/texts/files/NeARAZ-031008-3DCards.doc) (doc) and [Slides](/texts/files/NeARAZ-031008-3DCards.ppt) (ppt).

[**3D FAQ in Lithuanian**](/texts/lt3dfaq.html) (2003 Jul)<br/>
Some answers to questions I constantly receive :)

[**Reverse extruded shadow volumes**](/texts/revext.html) (2003 Feb)<br/>
Extrusion technique for stenciled shadow volumes. Enables self-shadowing while
using simplified shadow meshes. Features a small demo.
