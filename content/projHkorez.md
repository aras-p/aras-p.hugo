<H3>The present</H3>
<p>
<em>hKorez</em> now (2003 Jul) has got a successor - <A href="http://www.nesnausk.org/ffKorez"><strong>ffKorez</strong></A>,
that was made by one of hKorez developers.
</p>

<H3 clear="all">Description</H3>

<P>
<div style="float: right"><A href="http://www.nesnausk.org/ffKorez"><img src="img/tn/ffKorez.jpg"></A></div>
A group of friends-programmers decided to write a 3D engine and build a space
shooter game on it. The engine meant to feature "modular desing", "OOP" and
other buzzwords. Nothing is known about the game.
</P>

<H3>What's made</H3>

<P>
The engine. It had:
<UL>
<LI>Modular OOP design.
<LI>OpenGL/Win32 and software/Linux-svgalib renderers.
<LI>Scenegraph with sorting by renderstates and lights, view cone culling, etc.
<LI>VIPM meshes.
<LI>Scripting language for AI (see <A href="projBitikzyz.html">BiTikZyz</A>).
<LI>Unified resource management (textures, meshes, etc.).
<LI>Basic physics (dynamic octree and bounding spheres).
<LI>GUI system, mimicking Java's Swing by design.
<LI>Environment mapping, lens flares, skybox and similar eye-candies.
<LI><em>and lots of other stuff :)</em>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>What's missing</H3>
<P>
The game. Why: we all got hired by <A href="http://www.interamotion.com">
InteraMotion LLC</A> and thus had no time to write the game :)
</P>


<H3>The conclusion</H3>
<P>
The engine was a good start (to make the better engine). By itself the engine
is a (relatively) crap. So I don't give the binaries nor the source (unless
you're really interested and will ask personally).
</P>
<P>
But we all still hope to make the game (but maybe: different time/place/engine/game).
And it seems to be true - see <A href="http://www.nesnausk.org/ffKorez"><strong>ffKorez</strong></A>.
