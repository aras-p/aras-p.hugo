[Global Game Jam 2018](https://globalgamejam.org/2018) had a theme "Transmission". Lacking better
ideas, we saw that it's an anagram of "Trains in Moss", and made a game about trains being stuck in
the moss.

However my daughter got sick, and so we left home and continued on the game for some hours there.
My 8yo daughter did all the graphics, some sounds and game ideas. I assembled the stuff in Unity,
and did random key mashing in Garage Band to "make" the music track. It's nothing fancy, but
was quite fun to make!
