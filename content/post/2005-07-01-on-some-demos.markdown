Watched some new&old demos in the last couple of days. Here _(when there's a link to Lithuanian page, the 'download' looks like 'parsisi≈≥sti')_:

[Rapid Eye Movement](http://www.nesnausk.org/demoscene/Apzvalgos.php?id=124&r=1) by Matt Current. Now that's unreal; technically simple but excellent composition and creates a very strong feeling. The similar feeling I only remember from [The Planet](http://www.nesnausk.org/demoscene/Apzvalgos.php?id=45&r=1) by mfx. Also, I think the concept of "rapid eye movement" (i.e. the phase of the sleep) is done very well. I want to (be able to) do this!

[Aether](http://www.nesnausk.org/demoscene/Apzvalgos.php?id=121&r=1) by mfx. The first time it didn't leave me very impressed. However, I recommend watching it for the second time. Fascinating, though I can't say what exactly.

Old ones with a very strong music: [A Significant Deformation Near the Cranium](http://www.nesnausk.org/demoscene/Apzvalgos.php?id=111&r=1) by kewlers and [Coma (on the dance floor)](http://www.nesnausk.org/demoscene/Apzvalgos.php?id=57&r=1) by Cocoon. I want that music :)
