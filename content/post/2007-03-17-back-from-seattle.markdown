Just got back from [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Most_Valuable_Professional) Global Summit 2007 in Seattle. Among usual things, like watching [Bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates)'s [keynote](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2007/03-13MVPSummit.mspx), meeting other MVPs, DirectX/XNA guys, getting a grip of some NDA information and such, here are some of the other highlights:

Amsterdam airport:


> Officer: You speak English sir?  
> Me: Yeah.  
> O (takes a look at my passport): Ah, you speak Russian of course!  
> M: No, not really.  
> O: But your language is very similar to Russian, right?  
> M: Hm...


Well, here we know who gets the Linguist of the Year award.

Seattle-Tahoma airport, lady at checkin: "what kind of passport is that?". It also takes 5 times to enter my last name properly, from the printed letters in the passport. Each time trying to persuade me that I did change the ticket date of course!

Seattle-Tahoma airport, security: "sir, you have been selected for additional screening". Do they randomly select people for that quite involved process? Why this "selection" happens immediately after they take a look at my passport?

Random quotes:


> Ten minutes walk is a long distance! Ten minutes of walking distance in the States is a very good reason to buy a car. At least SUV; preferably a Hummer.
  

> DirectX SDK is the source of all sorts of high frequency goodness.

  
> Sony is always good at announcements.

  
> No? Rumours on the internet? Shock! Horror!
