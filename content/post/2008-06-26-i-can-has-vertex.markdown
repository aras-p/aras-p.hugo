[{% img right http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gt200.png 'I can has vertex data?' %}](http://aras-p.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/gt200.png)You know [something](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat) became a cultural phenomenon when hardware review sites start putting up images like this...

From AnandTech's [Radeon HD 4850 & 4870 review](http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3341&p=3): _I can has vertex data?_

_Edit_: gee, nowadays the reviews have funny performance measures. Like, [FPS per square centimeter](http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3341&p=7) (of GPU die size)! It does actually make sense, but it's still funny. Frames per second per square centimeter... mmm... delicious.
