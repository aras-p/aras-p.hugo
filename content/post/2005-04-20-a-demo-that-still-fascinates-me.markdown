Been thinking about how we should synchronize the visuals and the music in our demo... So I went and watched some of the classic demos, paying some extra attention at how they do it.

Synchronization aside, the demo that still touches me very deeply is [Gerbera by Moppi](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=3286). It's old (2001) and already starting to show it's age visually, but the whole mood, 'storyline' _(whatever that is)_, the tiny writings and the music is fascinating.

_Directions makes us unable to choose our paths_. Wonderful.
