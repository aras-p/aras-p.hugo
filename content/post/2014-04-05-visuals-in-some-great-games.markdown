title: Visuals in some great games

I was thinking about visuals of the best games I've recently played. Now, I'm not a PC/console gamer, and I am somewhat biased towards playing Unity-made games. So almost all these examples will be iPad & Unity games, however even taking my bias into account I think they are *amazing* games.

So here's some list (Unity games):

And just to make it slightly less biased, some non-Unity games:

[Papers, Please](http://papersplea.se/) by Lucas Pope.

Now for the strange part. At work I'm working on [physically based shading](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/03/20/physically-based-shading-upcoming-in-unity-5-0/) and things now, but take a look at the games above. Five out of eight are not "realistic looking" games at all! Lights, shadows, BRDFs, energy conservation and linear colors spaces don't apply *at all* to a game like DEVICE 6 or Papers, Please.

But that's okay. I'm happy that Unity is flexible enough to *allow* these games, and we'll certainly keep it that way. I was looking at our [game reel from GDC 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXfOqY0JMng) recently, and my reaction was "whoa, they all look different!". Which is really, really good.
