3:00PM. Last 8 hours frantic game progamming, before that 6 lazy hours at work. Must submit my work tomorrow, but the result looks really bad. Perhaps it was a big mistake.

Now: sleep, get up at 7:30, eat, ciao to daughter&wife, go to the gym, go to work, work, eat, edit demo storyboard for a break, work, shop, go home, play with daughter, browse a bit, guitar a bit, eat, wife comes home after 12hrs of teaching, we're all tired, talk a bit, sleep. Repeat?

Sleep.
