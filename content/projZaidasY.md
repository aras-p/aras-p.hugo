<P><strong>What?</strong><BR>
An old 2.5D Doom-like MS-DOS LAN shooter game.

<P><strong>Who?</strong><BR>
All programming and graphics was done by me, Aras Pranckevicius aka NeARAZ.
</P>

<P><strong>Features</strong>
<UL>
<LI>2.5D world with sprite-based objects. Rendering/collision is based on 2D
    BSP tree, with various features and hacks to make it "3D". <em>Reminds
    of Doom, huh?</em>.
<LI>MCGA (320x200x256) graphics.
<LI>LAN play with up to 8 players (IPX protocol).
<LI>Stupid bots, in case no LAN is available.
<LI>Command console, with event binding system similar to Quake.
<LI>11 distinct weapons, good&amp;bad effects, items and pickups.
<LI>Ability to turn off texturing for slow computers.
<LI>Stereo sound.
</UL>

<P><strong>Requirements</strong>
<UL>

<LI>Disk space: approx. 1.5 megabytes.
<LI>Video: VGA.
<LI>Sound: nothing or SB (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, Pro, 16). Does not work on some
    SB clones.
</UL>
</P>

<P><strong>Creation</strong><BR>
Created with Watcom C/C++ 11.0 compiler, Dos Navigator for editing files,
Autodesk Animator 1.0 for drawing, 3D Studio R4 for ThreeDee work, and a
part of Allegro library sound code. Time of creation: 1998 February-August and
1999 January-June.
</P>

<P><strong>Usage</strong><BR>
Copy to some directory, read "readme.txt" and "relyzai.txt" and do along the
instructions found there. And, just in case: <em>the language used there and
in the game is Lithuanian :)</em>.
