#### What?
An old 2.5D Doom-like MS-DOS LAN shooter game. Made in 1998-1999.

#### Who?
All programming and graphics was done by me, Aras Pranckevičius aka NeARAZ.

#### Features

- 2.5D world with sprite-based objects. Rendering/collision is based on 2D
    BSP tree, with various features and hacks to make it "3D". *Reminds
    of Doom, huh?*.
- MCGA (320x200x256) graphics.
- LAN play with up to 8 players (IPX protocol).
- Stupid bots, in case no LAN is available.
- Command console, with event binding system similar to Quake.
- 11 distinct weapons, good&bad effects, items and pickups.
- Ability to turn off texturing for slow computers.
- Stereo sound.

#### Requirements

- CPU: at least Intel 386, normal play under Intel 486 66MHz.
- RAM: approx. 2 megabytes.
- OS: MS-DOS, Win3.x, Win9x/ME.
- Disk space: approx. 1.5 megabytes.
- Video: VGA.
- Sound: nothing or SB (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, Pro, 16). Does not work on some
    SB clones.

#### Creation

Created with Watcom C/C++ 11.0 compiler, Dos Navigator for editing files,
Autodesk Animator 1.0 for drawing, 3D Studio R4 for ThreeDee work, and a
part of Allegro library sound code. Time of creation: 1998 February-August and
1999 January-June.

#### Usage
Copy to some directory, read `readme.txt` and `relyzai.txt` and do along the
instructions found there. And, just in case: *the language used there and
in the game is Lithuanian :)*.
